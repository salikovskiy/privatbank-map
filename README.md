## Ottawa Skatepark Infrastructure Map

 Initially, it was supposed to be a cool project that would be filled with data from the PrivatBank public API, but the API didn't work and the project had to be closed

 Now the project is filled with data on Ottawa's skateparks

Lesson:
> Always check that the API works before coding
