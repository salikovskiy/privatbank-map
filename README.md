## Ottawa Skatepark Infrastructure Map
### [ðŸ’½ Demo](https://hike-app-b2db2.firebaseapp.com/) 

 In this project, the main thing I learned is that I need to check if API works before you want to build the whole project on it.
 
 Initially, it was supposed to be a cool project that would be filled with data from the PrivatBank public API, but the API didn't work and the project had to be closed

 Now the project is filled with data on Ottawa's skateparks

***

> Always check that the API works before coding
